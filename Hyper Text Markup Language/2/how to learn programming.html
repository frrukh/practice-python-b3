            Just the thought of learning to code can be very intimidating.
            The word code is mysterious by definition. It implies a technical
            form of communication that computers, and not humans, are 
            meant to understand.
        
                    <!-- using img tag to show an image and in image tag using src attribute to give the link of the image, and in this attribute I used an online image link and using alt attribute to give the alternate of the image , now in case when the image will not load , the alternative text will show on the screen, and using height  or width attribulte to give the image size.we can set height and width of image at same time but adviseable is that we shuld set on height or only width so if we set height the brouser automaticaly set the width purpotionaly but if we set both there is a huge chances that the purpotion of the image will damage -->

            One way many people start learning to code is by picking a 
            popular programming language and jumping in head first 
            with no direction. This could take the form of an online 
            coding course, a tutorial project, or a random book purchase 
            on a specific topic.


            Rarely do prospective developers start with a roadmap – a bird's eye 
            view of the coding world that outlines a set of relevant 
            programming concepts, languages, and tools that almost 100% of 
            developers use every day.


            In this article, I propose one such roadmap. 
            <u><i><b>I do this by outlining 14 steps</b></i></u> – each one discussing 
            an essential concept, language, or tool – that professional 
            developers use to write code, collaborate, and create professional 
            projects.


            I meticulously chose these 14 steps based on my own personal 
            journey learning to code, which spans almost 20 years.

             <img src="../images/local/journey.jpg" alt="a man on a journey" height="350px">

            Part of the reason it took me so long to feel comfortable as 
            a developer is that I would learn about specific topics without 
            a broader context of the coding world.


            Each of the steps in this article discusses a "coding essential" 
            – something that I believe <b> is critical to at least know that 
            it exists </b> at the start of your coding journey.

            One final note before listing the steps in the roadmap: 
            of course reading this article will not make you an expert programmer. 
            It isn't meant to. The purpose of this article is to make you aware 
            that each one of these topics exists, and hopefully give you a basic 
            idea of how each one works so you can build on it intelligently going forward.
