    <!-- It is a framework for CSS that is used to create amazing layouts and much more -->
    <!-- Like bootstrap it has its own predefined classes and we just have to assign the class and the styling will applied  -->
    <!-- in bootstrap we have a CSS file and we just have to link that with code but in Tailwind we have a script file that generate the CSS code so the Tailwind is faster then bootstrap as it does't have 12000+ lines of code to load ! -->
    <!-- IN bootstrap we can't customize the bootstrap's classes but against that in Tailwind we can customize the classes as we wish -->
